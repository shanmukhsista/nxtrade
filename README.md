# About

I'm starting this project to work on a trading journal that can be used by every trader who wants a smart journaling system with minimal effort. I looked up a lot of solutions online but i'm not convinced with any existing solutions. 

# Proposal 

I envision this project to host a Journaling system that is capable of performing the following tasks at minimum : 

1. Simple Mobile Friendly Journaling. 
2. Automatic Imports from Brokers
3. Transaction Tagging. 
4. Risk Analysis
5. Performance Analytics for Trades


# Willing to Contribute ?
